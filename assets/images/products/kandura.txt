This is a placeholder file for a kandura product image.

In a real implementation, this file would be replaced with actual product image files for kanduras, such as:
- kandura-1.jpg
- kandura-2.jpg
- kandura-3.jpg
- kandura-4.jpg
- kandura-5.jpg

Each product should have multiple images showing different angles, details, and variations of the product.

Please replace this placeholder with actual product image files.
